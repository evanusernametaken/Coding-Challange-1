This repository contains a simple Swift demonstration that explains how to store an app name, track a version number, and update that version. The purpose of this project is to show how constants, variables, and basic string printing work in Swift without overwhelming the reader with too much detail.
The program begins by defining the name of the app as a constant and the current version as a variable. It prints both values so the initial state is visible. After that, the version number is increased by 0.1 to simulate an update, and the updated value is printed again. This shows how Swift handles changing values and how string interpolation can be used to display information.
When the program runs, it first shows the original version number and then displays the updated version. This helps demonstrate the difference between a constant, which cannot be changed, and a variable, which can be modified during the program’s execution.
To run this project, create a Swift file and paste the source code into it. You can execute it using the Swift command-line tools or by opening the file in Xcode and running it through the IDE. Either method will produce the same printed output and allow you to observe how the version number increases each time the update occurs.
